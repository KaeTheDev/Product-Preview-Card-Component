## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project went way better than my recipe page, which I plan on redoing. I worked a lot harder on getting the responsiveness right for all screens and making it as close to the final design as possible.

This project really showed me that I have HTML and CSS/SCSS under control. The biggest takeaway was learning when to use a mobile-first approach and how to properly apply different screen responsiveness techniques.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue improving my understanding of:

- Mobile-first vs. desktop-first approaches
- Handling responsiveness efficiently with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Optimizing layouts for different screen sizes
